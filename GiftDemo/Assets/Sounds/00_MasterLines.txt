rachel_racecar	Racecar driver.
rachel_tellyouabout	We're here to tell you about the eye see tee Virtual Human Toolkit.
rachel_igotthis	I got this Brad.  When you speak to us, your words are sent to the NPC Editor, a statistical text classifier, which then selects our best response.  The non-verbal behavior generator then chooses our gestures and gazes which are synchronized with our responses by SmartBody.
rachel_peoplecreate	The toolkit allows people like you to create virtual humans, like us!

rachel_domore	BUT we hope to be given the ability to do more!  Like actually see and react to you.
rachel_charlikeus	A virtual human is a character like us.  We can perceive real humans and respond both verbally and non-verbally.
rachel_mtl	The toolkit is made up of many modules, tools and libraries.  The main modules are the NPCEditor, which is like our brain; the Non-verbal Behavior Generator, which as I'm sure you've already guessed, generates our non-verbal behavior; SmartBody, a procedural animation system; and Watson, a vision system.
